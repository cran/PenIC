Description: Currently incorporate the generalized odds-rate model (a type of linear 
    transformation model) for interval-censored data based on penalized monotonic B-Spline. 
    More methods under other semiparametric models such as cure model or additive model will
    be included in future versions. For more details see Lu, M., Liu, Y., Li, C. and Sun, J.
